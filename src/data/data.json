        "publishedDate": "2020-12-15",
        "description": "\"Tech writer Roberts debuts with a page-turning account of the rise of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase from the Y Combinator startup incubator to becoming a 'pillar of the larger crypto economy.'\" — Publisher's Weekly For a moment late in 2018, one bitcoin, which physically amounts to a few electrons blipping on a tiny bit of silicon, was worth $20,000—the same as a pound of gold. Libertarian technologists who believed bitcoin would be the foundation of a new world order saw the moment as an apotheosis. Everyone else saw a bubble. Everyone else was right, and the bubble burst. But bitcoin survived, and the battle for its soul rages on. Kings of Crypto drops us into the unfolding drama, tracing the rise, fall, and rebirth of cryptocurrency through the experiences of major players across the globe. We follow Silicon Valley entrepreneur Brian Armstrong and the turbulent rocket ride of his startup, Coinbase, as he tries to take bitcoin mainstream while fighting off hackers, thieves, and zealots. Author Jeff John Roberts keenly observes the world of virtual currencies and what happens when startups try to disrupt the world of high finance. Clear explanations of crypto technology are woven into an amazing landscape full of meme-fueled startup hijinks, hacking (so much hacking!), shady investors, government investigations, billionaire bros and their Lambos, and closed-door meetings with Jamie Dimon. This is the surprising story of the origins of cryptocurrency and how it is changing money forever.",

        "description": "The Crypto Market Ecosystem has emerged as the most profound application of blockchain technology in finance. This textbook adopts an integrated approach, linking traditional functions of the current financial system (payments, traded assets, fundraising, regulation) with the respective functions in the crypto market, in order to facilitate the reader in their understanding of how this new ecosystem works. The book walks the reader through the main features of the blockchain technology, the definitions, classifications, and distinct characteristics of cryptocurrencies and tokens, how these are evaluated, how funds are raised in the cryptocurrency ecosystem (ICOs), and what the main regulatory approaches are. The authors have compiled more than 100 sources from different sub-fields of economics, finance, and regulation to create a coherent textbook that provides the reader with a clear and easily understandable picture of the new world of encrypted finance and its applications. The book is primarily aimed at business and finance students, who already have an understanding of the basic principles of how the financial system works, but also targets a more general readership, by virtue of its broader scope and engaging and accessible tone.",

        "description": "Crypto currency integrated BlockChain under Virtual Scalable Enterprises is a widely debated and earnestly discussed topic in the technology arena. Executives at the largest institutions are calling crypto currency fraudulent while high-level institutional banking professionals are leaving their positions to jump into crypto technology, regulation and investment opportunities as industries advance towards adoption. The narratives on these topics are diametrically opposite and polarizing on both side of the debate. While this debate has many layers from a government regulatory side to social impact to the practicality of everyday use of crypto currencies in developing markets, it is safe to assume that crypto currencies or utility tokens are more than a global phenomenon and are now becoming a working framework for optional modes of business. This book demystifies what crypto currency is, how it is used, and what it means to the consumer, investor, and the future of our global currency marketplace. By providing the historical backdrop to the market, authors Sarah Swammy, Richard Thompson, and Marvin Loh provide a clear definition of what crypto-currencies actually are, how they are being used and by whom, and the unique reasons why they have gone from back street to Main Street almost overnight. The book will also delve into the government’s role in regulating this commerce medium. Lastly, the authors will look at the current global monetary policy and discuss if this type of currency phenomena was a direct result while also examining the potential risk and rewards for investors and the economy.",

        "description": "This book examines current debates about the politics of technology and the future of democratic practices in the digital era. The volume centres on the debates on digital encryption in Germany and the USA, during the aftermath of Edward Snowden’s leaks, which revolved around the value of privacy and the legitimacy of surveillance practices. Using a discourse analysis of mass media and specialist debates, it shows how these are closely interlinked with technological controversies and how, as a result, contestation emerges not within one public sphere but within multiple expert circles. The book develops the notion of ‘publicness’ in order to grasp the political significance of these controversies, thereby making an innovative contribution to Critical Security Studies by introducing digital encryption as an important site for understanding the broader debates on cyber security and surveillance. This book will be of much interest to students of critical security studies, science and technology studies, and International Relations.",

Take a real-time journey, cutting through the myths, understanding token choices available to everyone. Key Features Interviews with key figures in Tokenomics Unbiased evaluation and comparison of the different offerings Conceptual analysis of the market’s reaction League table showing current exposure An account of the theoretical and current legal foundations of alt coins and tokens A complete introduction to the phases of an initial coin offering Book Description Tokenomics is the economy of this new world. This is a no-holds-barred, in-depth exploration of the way in which we can participate in the blockchain economy. The reader will learn the basics of bitcoin, blockchains, and tokenomics; what the very first ICO was; and how over a period of 5 years, various projects managed to raise the enormous sums of money they did. The book then provides insights from ICO experts and looks at what the future holds. By comparing the past, current, and future of this technology, the book will inform anyone, whatever motivates their interest. The crypto shift of blockchains, ICOs, and tokens is much more than just buying bitcoins, creating tokens, or raising millions in a minute in an ICO. It is a new paradigm shift from centralized to decentralized, from closed to open, and from opaqueness to transparency. ICOs and the creation of tokens during the craze of 2017 needed a lot of preparation, an understanding of cryptocurrencies and of emerging legal frameworks, but this has spurred a new movement to tokenize the world. The author gives an unbiased, authoritative picture of the current playing field, exploring the token opportunities and provides a unique insight into the developing world of this tokenized economy. This book will nourish hungry minds wanting to grow their knowledge in this fascinating area. What you will learn The background of ICOs and how they came to be The difference between a coin and a token, a utility and a security, and all the other acronyms you’re likely to ever encounter How these ICOs raised enormous sums of money Tokenomics: structuring the token with creativity Why it’s important to play nicely with the regulators A sneak peak into the future of ICOs from leaders in the industry Who this book is for With the media hype about bitcoin, this book appeals to anyone, from those with a general interest in anything crypto, or those with some knowledge of the nuances between cryptocurrency, ICOs, IPOs and the Token economy.",

        "description": "Christopher Middleton's writing in Crypto-Topographia falls within the genre of 'short prose', which Middleton defines as 'liminal, ludic and disruptive'. Many of the texts concern places, singly or clustered, which offer their own secret store of time: lived time, signs of presence, whispers or howls. Time is stretched back, folded or pretended, and can transform a group of trees into 'the locus of a drama' ('A Close Shave With Sacrilege'). Sometimes place is supplanted by object: sliding carpets and material colour... Dispersed among variously 'situated' texts, history scintillates, not as a plan, but as an ensemble of glimpses. The epilogue records a strange episode of travel, 'The Gaze of the Turkish Mona Lisa', a masterly description of a Turkish lady, whom Middleton manages to depict, while refraining from looking at her.",

Terrorized by manners, mannequins, and mange-touts, Merril searches through the emotional debris of designer London for a reason why he ever bothered to fall in love. A richly comic urban novel, The Crypto-Amnesia Club does for London what Bright Lights, Big City did for New York.",

        "description": "In late 2008, under the long shadow cast by the most severe economic crisis in generations, a revolutionary new form of currency was quietly being shaped. At the time no one could have predicted that an obscure form of electronic money would in less than a decade prove to be the most important financial innovation of the 21st century—a tool that would spark an entire new economic institution: crypto economy. That once-obscure money was known as Bitcoin, and today it is the highest valued digital coin. And though consumers continue to scramble to cash in on the trending currency, the technology behind Bitcoin known as Blockchain, which allows the currency to bought and sold without regulation by a government, remains a mystery to the public. In Crypto Economy, Aries Wanlin Wang provides the definitive blueprint for understanding how Bitcoin, Blockchain, and other digital technologies are disrupting traditional financial institutions and forever changing the world of commerce.",

REVIEWS FOR THE BOOK \"Educative addition to the technical trader's shelf.\" — The Hindu Business Line \"Clearly explains and reinforces the message of each candlestick pattern, pointing out other details that can help determine success or failure at each occurrence. The real life examples are manifold, well chosen and amplify the lessons being taught. Highly recommended reading for traders in all markets to discover ways of profiting from candlestick trading.\" — Alan Northcott \"Sadekar's book not only manages to live upto the expectations but probably excels them. Sadekar attempts to keep things simple, and targets the beginner to intermediate level technician as his target audience. Each type of reversal, consolidation and continuation pattern is tackled in individual chapters and illustrated liberally with charts of Indian stocks. The author leaves ample strategies for the not so active trader, also combining Dow theory tools like trend lines, oscillators and moving averages with the oriental techniques. This gives the reader an immediate advantage of getting the best of both the worlds. While all chapters are interesting read, chapters 11 & 12 are the highlights of the book as they lay out a simple but actionable game plan for a trader and investor. As if the overall package was not sweet enough, Sadekar has compiled a tear-away candlestick ready-reckoner at the end of the book to identify emerging patterns in real time. At its price, the book is a value buy. All in all, a must read book for every freshman candle sticks trader.\" — Vijay L. Bhambwani, Technical Analyst, CEO - BSPLIndia.com",
